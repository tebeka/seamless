`seamless` is a TCP proxy that allow you to deploy new code then switch traffic
to new backend without downtime.

Switching backends is done with HTTP interface with the following API:

    `/switch?backend=address` 
        switch traffic to new backend

    `/current` 
        return (in plain text) current server

Process
=======
* Start first backend at port 4444
* Run
  ::

    seamless 8080 localhost:4444
* Direct all traffic to port 8080 on local machine.

When you need to upgrade the backend, start a new one (with new code on a
different port, say 4445). Then::

    curl http://localhost:6777/switch?backend=localhost:4445.
